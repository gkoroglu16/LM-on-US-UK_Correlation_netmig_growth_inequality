# Project Title: Exogenous Population Growth as A Source of Dynamism to Economic Growth: In context of the United States

## Hypothesis: Can exogenous population growth (excluding fertility and mortality rates – only immigration effect) spur the dynamism-needed for an economic growth? 

-	Focus on 4 specific relationships:
1.	GDP per capita growth (net migration) – Net Migration
2.	Exports of goods and services (annual % growth) – Net Migration
3.	Income share held by lowest 20% - Net Migration
4.	Households and NPISHs Final Consumption Expenditure (annual % growth) – Net Migration

-	Analysis from 1960-2020 (no specific dates, or events) – neutral look over the course of history
-	For inference purpose only, not an attempt of projection
-	Possible ‘lag’ in projections/interpretations? (This is my concern. I am not sure how to deal with this?). This is just a start.


## Abstract:
2020 US Census results were striking at the point that 2010-2020 (7.4%) has been the slowest population growth since 1930-1940 (7.3%). 

Global order was shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic and now, there are discussion of another “Roaring 20s” (“Goodbye virus-ridden 2020, hello Roaring Twenties”, Sandbu from Financial Times, 2020). 

These 2020s and onwards could be something interesting to see from this research question. 

Especially developed economies, now, are looking for ways to shrink away from the pandemic depression and they are searching for paths to spur economic growth and secure their long-term global political economy positions. 

This research starter was my undergraduate independent study project on Quantitative Political Economy.

It is to analyze the previous relationships of population growth via effects of immigration policies (exogenous population growth) (Bucci, 2015) for energizing the economic growth.
